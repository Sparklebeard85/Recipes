    <h1>Spaghetti</h1>
    <img src="images/Spaghetti.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>4 Italian sausage links</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice sausages lengthwise, leaving links attached along one side; lay flat in a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 5 minutes, flipping once. Transfer to a plate; set aside. </li>
        <li>Add ground beef, onion, garlic, and olive oil to the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until onion is translucent and beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain all but 2 tablespoons drippings from the skillet. Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes, oregano, salt, basil, bay leaf, and black pepper; simmer, uncovered, over low heat until flavors have blended, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Stir spaghetti into sauce. </li>
        <li>Divide spaghetti and sauce among individual oven-safe baking dishes or plates; top each with a cooked half sausage and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and begins to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
